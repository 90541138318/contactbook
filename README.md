# Contact Book

A simple contact book web application built with **Vue 3**, **Vue Router 4**, and **Vite**. This app allows you to manage your contacts efficiently. All data is stored in the browser's **localStorage**, ensuring it persists between sessions.

## Features
- 📄 **View all contacts** sorted alphabetically by last name  
- 🔍 **Search/filter contacts** by first or last name  
- ➕ **Add a new contact**  
- ✏️ **Edit an existing contact**  
- 🗑️ **Delete a contact**

## Technologies Used
- **Vue 3** – Frontend framework for building reactive user interfaces  
- **Vue Router 4** – Client-side routing for navigating between views  
- **Vite** – Lightning-fast development build tool  
- **localStorage** – Browser storage for data persistence
